These datasets include various clinical and demographic variables for subjects with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD) and Controls, as well as genetic markers and lifestyle factors, structured as follows:

Demographics: Sex (1: Male, 2: Female), age at last visit/death, age at onset, disease duration

Survival Status: 0 = censored, 1 = deceased

Cancer Data: Cancer presence (1 = Yes, 2 = No), cancer timing (1 = before PD, 2 = after PD)

Cancer Location Codes: Codes for different cancer types (e.g., 1 = hematologic, 2 = digestive, etc.)

Lifestyle Factors: Smoking status (e.g., 1 = Yes, >10 cigarettes/day), drinking status (e.g., >40 g ethanol/day)

Genetic Markers: HTT alleles, APOE alleles, and SCA (Spinocerebellar Ataxia) markers with codes for normal, intermediate alleles (AI), and expanded alleles.
